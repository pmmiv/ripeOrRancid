# Ripe or Racid
## Onion Article Rating

by PM Milam IV

### Purpose:

This application scrapes the most recent onion articles, and allows the user to review them and rate each as Ripe (funny) or Rancid (unfunny). The user can then review the choices they have made by visiting the ripe and rancid pages. Once there, the user can leave comments on the articles, remove the article all together, or update whether or not the article is ripe or rancid.

This is a full stack application and is deployed on [Heroku](https://ripeorrancid.herokuapp.com)
